        Welcome to the Draft Assistant! So how this tool works is it will be showing you who the top players are while drafting.
        There are 3 columns:
        <ol>
          <li>Live user drafting matched with Draft Order interface from ESPN</li>
          <li>Top players to pick and who we suggest to draft based on our rankings</li>
          <li>All players remaining in the draft matched with our rankings, this is just for looking over for you</li>
        </ol>
        So when drafting1, when a someone picks a player, click on that button in the first column, and the suggested players will update. 
        Repeat that process the whole draft, and when it is your pick, remember to pick both the player on the draft and the player button on here.
      </p>
      <h3>
        *REMEMBER: Quarterbacks are not included in this draft assistant, so remember to draft them at your preference, but we suggest
        around the 5th to 7th round to get more position players. AND KEEP TRACK OF YOUR POSITION NEEDS.*
